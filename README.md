# Text Regression in Law Judgements

Regression applied to law texts from JEC / UFSC to predict the compensation for moral damage related to failures in air transport services.

## Scope

We aim to check many techniques related to text representation, regression and final evaluation.

In terms of text representation, we apply the following:

- Bag of Words with TF values
- Bag of Words with TF-IDF values
- Word embeddings trained from large legal corpora (TODO: Cite out paper)  
- Bag of Words with Word embeddings values
- Word Embeddings with Dimensionality Reduction

In terms of regression models, we apply the following:

- Linear Regression
- Polinomial Regression
- Support Vector Machine
- Random Forest
- Convolutional Neural Network with and without Attention
- Long Short Term Memory with and without Attention

In terms of regression evaluation, we apply the following:

- R²
- Adjusted R²
- Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
- ...
